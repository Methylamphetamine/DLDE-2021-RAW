Reviewer 1.

- Acknowledge that we need better relation to literature.
- Cyr paper, compare and contrast, cite and experiment
- Two fixed points, need to clarify
- Cite work for first layer orthogonality
- Frequency bias need to be addressed to be related to DLDE
- Why use orthogonality, motivation from classical methods to fit complex functions
- Change legends
- Complexity of MLP, briefly mention, synthetic experiment (not for this workshop)
- More thorough comparison to SIREN
- Variance of SIREN hidden layer weights

Reviewer 2.

- Motivation, connection from dynamical system and othogonality objectives
- Empirical evidence shown in the paper that NTK has shorter length
- Comparison study about other orthogonal initialization
- Cost of computation
